Building Presage 64-bit on MinGW-w64/MSYS 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following steps will enable your system to build and execute
presage in native 64-bit Windows.


______________________
Install MinGW-w64/MSYS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Download the current MinGW-w64 64-bit toolchain
[http://mingw-w64.sourceforge.net/] from the MinGW-builds project
(tested with the Windows 64 host, SEH exception handling, x86_64
target) and install the latest, i.e.:

  /c/presage_x64_sdk/mingw-builds/x64-4.8.1-posix-seh-rev5


Download the ultra-inclusive mingw-builds MSYS package from the
MinGW-builds external-binary-packages download page and extract:

  /c/presage_x64_sdk/mingw-builds/msys

Edit the /etc/fstab to add the following mount point:

  c:/presage_x64_sdk/mingw-builds/x64-4.8.1-posix-seh-rev5/mingw64 /mingw


______________
Install Python
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(Optional) Install using Python x86-x64 Windows Installer. No special
notes here, just click next. The examples below assume Python is
installed in:

  /c/presage_x64_sdk/Python27

N.B. The python x64 distribution does not currently ship an import library. To build a python extension module, we need to generate an import library for python27.dll (which, in case of a system wide python installation, resides in the System32 Windows folder):

  cd /c/presage_x64_sdk/Python27/libs
  gendef /c/Windows/System32/python27.dll
  dlltool.exe --dllname python27.dll --def python27.def --output-lib libpython27.a


________________
Install wxPython
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(Optional) Install using wxPython runtime installer matching the
installed Python version.  Just click next, and make sure that
site-packages directory the installer picks up is correct.


____________
Install SWIG
~~~~~~~~~~~~

(Optional) Install SWIG for Windows by simply unzipping it. The
examples below assume SWIG is installed in:

  /c/presage_x64_sdk/SWIG


___________
Install GTK
~~~~~~~~~~~

(Optional) Install GTK for Windows 64-bit by simply unzipping the
latest all-in-one bundle. The examples below assume GTK is installed
in:

  /c/presage_x64_sdk/GTK


__________
Install QT
~~~~~~~~~~

(Optional) Download QT x64 from the MinGW-builds
external-binary-packages download page, making sure that it matches the
MinGW-builds toolchain and extract, i.e.:

  /c/presage_x64_sdk/x64-Qt-4.8.5+qtcreator-2.8.0-RC-gcc-4.8.1-seh-rev1

Remember to execute qtbinpatcher to reset hardcoded paths in the
binaries to your actual QT installation directory.


__________________
Install QScintilla
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(Optional) Download QScintilla, extract, build and install following
the instructions provided in the QScintilla README file.


_______________
Install SQLite3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Get the SQLite3 amalgamation source distribution and untar it.

Start the MSYS console and change into the SQLite3 source directory.

Configure, build, and install:
    ./configure
    make
    make install


_____________
Build presage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Start MSYS shell

Extract and configure presage, taking care of specifying where to
find required binaries (Python and SWIG), headers, and libraries:

  PATH=$PATH:/c/presage_x64_sdk/GTK/bin:/c/presage_x64_sdk/Python27:/c/presage_x64_sdk/SWIG \
  PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/c/presage_x64_sdk/GTK/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig \
  CPPFLAGS="-I/c/presage_x64_sdk/Python27/include -I/usr/local/include" \
  LIBS="-L/usr/local/lib" \
  ./configure --prefix=/c/presage_x64_install
 
  make
  make install


Presage is now installed in c:\presage_x64_install
