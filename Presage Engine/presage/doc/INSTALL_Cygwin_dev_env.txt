How to install Cygwin development environment on Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following steps will turn your puny Windows platform into a fully
featured Unix-like development environment.

You should follow these steps if you intend to build Presage for
Windows from source.


_________________________________
STEP 0: Download Cygwin installer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Point your trusted browser to 

  http://www.cygwin.com

and click on the `Install or Update now' to download the installer.

When the download completes, run the setup.exe executable. This will
guide you through the Cygwin installation process.

Click next to accept the default selections until you get to the
package selection dialog.

Beware that some Cygwin mirrors do not work reliably. If you
experience problems retrieving packages from the Internet, be sure to
try a different mirror. Your mileage may vary.


________________________________________
STEP 1: Select which packages to install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You want to make sure that the following packages are selected:

  Devel
    autoconf
    automake
    cppunit (optional)
    gcc-g++
    help2man (optional)
    libncurses-devel (optional)
    libtool
    make
    pkg-config
    subversion
    swig (optional)

  Database
    libsqlite3-devel
    sqlite3

  Interpreters
    python (optional)


then go ahead and click next. The packages will download and install
in your system.

Ensure that `Create icon on Desktop' is ticked before you click
finish.


____________________________________________________________
STEP 2: Copy the Presage distribution to your home directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Double-click on the Cygwin icon that was created by the Cygwin
installation program. This opens a bash shell and puts you in your
cygwin home directory.

Copy the Presage distribution to your home directory by following
these simple steps:

  - type `cp' followed by a space
  - drag and drop the Presage distribution file in the shell
  - type a space followed by a dot `.'
  - press ENTER

Please ensure that the full path to the directory where you copy the
presage distribution does not contain spaces (libtool might choke
on space separated paths, depending on which version is
installed). You can check that by issuing the `pwd' command.


_____________________________________
STEP 3: Install the required packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Cygwin now includes SQLite 3. SQLite 3.x is recommended over SQLite
2.8.x. However, should you want to use SQLite 2.8.x instead, you will
have to manually download and install it.

[ONLY follow these steps if you require to use SQLite version 2.8.x
instead of SQLite version 3.x]

You will need to get the source from the cvs repository. Instructions
are available on sqlite.org download page.

In short, you will have to run:
cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@www.sqlite.org:/sqlite login
cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@www.sqlite.org:/sqlite checkout sqlite
cd sqlite
cvs update -r version_2
(password is "anonymous")

Build and install SQLite by following the excellent instructions
provided with the package.

It is just a matter of running: 

  ./configure
  make
  make install

in most cases.


_____________________________________
STEP 4: And you are ready to start...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The development environment is installed and ready for action.

Now follow the steps detailed in the README file to build and install
Presage.

Enjoy,
Matteo
