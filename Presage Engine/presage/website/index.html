Presage, an intelligent predictive text entry platform
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Presage is an intelligent, extensible and pluggable predictive text
entry platform.


Introduction
------------

Communication is a basic human need. Electronic text is an
increasingly important communication medium. Textual interaction and
electronic text generation are essential to effective communication.

However, electronic text generation may be cumbersome if:
- the device is equipped with a limited text entry system, such as
devices lacking a standard keyboard, i.e. portable devices, PDAs and
mobile phones
- the user has physical or linguistic disabilities which might impair
their speed, accuracy, or altogether prevent their access to
electronic text creation

A predictive text entry system attempts to improve ease and speed of
textual input.

Word prediction consists in computing which word tokens or word
completions are most likely to be entered next. The system analyses
the text already entered and combines the information thus extracted
with other information sources to calculate a set of most probable
tokens.

The set of most probable tokens, a list of suggestions, is displayed
to the user. If the token the user intended to enter is in the list,
the user selects it and it is automatically entered by the system.

If the list of suggestions does not contain the desired word, the user
continues entering text until the correct suggestion is offered or
until the user is done entering text.


Concepts
--------

How can presage predict what text the user is going to enter next?

The approach relies on information theory. Natural language is
modelled as an information source. Natural language is a redundant
information source.

The key idea is modelling natural language as a set of redundant
sources of information. The redundancy embedded in natural language is
exploited by various predictive methods to extract information in
order to generate predictions.

Information sources can be classified as statistical,
syntactic and semantic.

Statistical sources
-------------------
If one were asked to guess what word followed the following text
fragment: ``The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy ...''
, one would most likely reply ``dog''.

``The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'' is in fact a widely
known "pangram" (a sentence which uses every letter of the alphabet at
least once).

One would pick the word ``dog'' on the grounds that, given the history
string ``The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy ...'', ``dog'' most
frequently follows. ("frequentist" approach to statistical
information)

Likewise, one would pick ``over'' or ``on'' when given the fragment
``The quick brown fox jumps ...'' on account that the words that most
frequently follow the verb ``jump'' are either ``on'' or ``over''.

Syntactic sources
-----------------
Continuing the previous example, one would pick the words ``over'' or
``on'' when given the context:

``The quick brown fox jumps o'' (note the final letter ``o'')

A syntactically aware predictive plugin could exploit the fact that
``to jump'' is an intransitive verb and should be followed by an
adverb. ``on'' and ``over'' are adverbs and begin with the letter
``o'', which makes them strong candidates for a prediction.

Semantic sources
----------------
Supposing one had been writing about the adventures of a cunning fox
and a loyal dog for a while, then one would suggest that ``dog'' is
the most likely object to be jumped over by the ``fox'':

``The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy d''

Information about the context and (however limited) comprehension of
it provides additional information to increase predictive accuracy.

The resulting language model is powerful, flexible and extensible.


Presage
-------

Presage is an intelligent predictive text entry platform.

Presage's platform consists of a set of modules that provide
functionality required by predictive plugins.

Presage's predictive capabilities are implemented by predictive
plugins. Predictive plugins use the services provided by the
Presage platform to implement a given prediction technique.

Presage is extensible. Its reliance on predictive plugins means
that additional predictive capabilities can be integrated by writing
new predictive plugins.

Presage is flexible and configurable. Its flexibility and
configurability derives from its plugin based architecture. This
flexibility translates into ease of experimentation with new
predictive techniques and improved users' experience.

Individual users can tailor presage's predictive capabilities to
their needs and obtain the best benefits from its predictions.

Presage uses Plump, the Pluggable Lightweight Ubiquitous
Multithreaded Platform as its underlying plugin architecture.
http://sourceforge.net/projects/plump/

Presage also provides a set of predictive plugins and predictive
resources.

Whenever predictive resources are generated from data, tools to
generate and extract predictive resources from raw data is included in
the platform.

Presage aims to provide the best predictive text entry capabilities
and provide a platform to ease development and addition of innovative
predictive capabilities.


It is hoped that this tool will help as many users as possible.


Architecture
------------

The Presage platform aims to be modular, extensible, configurable
and pluggable.

Presage's extensibility is achieved through pervasive usage of
plugins. Its core functionality is provided by intelligent components
which can be effortlessly plugged into the system. This plugin design
encourages decoupling of prediction mechanisms and foster reuse of the
basic services offered by presage's core modules.

Presage's pluggability means that presage predictive
capabilities can be easily integrated into an existing
system. Presage transparently reads the characters entered by the
user and returns predictions.

Presage's configurability is a direct conseguence of its plugin
architecture and of the flexible design of its core components. The
user can customize presage's predictive functionality by choosing
which predictive plugins to use. The behaviour of the core modules is
controlled by an easily editable XML file.

Presage's modularity translates to the following architecture:
* ContextTracker
 Keeps track of user's input.
 Responds to predictive plugin's queries regarding the context.

* Tokenizer
 Breaks a string into tokens based on configurable separators.
 Works in reverse order, starting from end of string.

* Selector
 Determines which suggestions should be returned as a prediction.
 Decisions are based on configurable parameters.

* Predictor
 Coordinates individual predictive plugins.

* Combiner
 Merges the suggestions returned by different predictive plugins
 into a single prediction.

* PluginManager

* ProfileManager


Current status
--------------

Platform: complete, some modules should be rewritten and optimized

Plugins: statical predictive plugins are provided, syntactic and
semantic plugins have been designed but not yet been developed.


Future
------

Short term:
* overhaul of presage architecture and integration of the plump framework
* restructure configuration and plugin directories
* generate multilanguage prediction resources

Medium term:
* add more tests to increase coverage
* implement Combinator class
* implement abbreviation expansion plugin

Long term:
* add more predictive plugins

Longer term:
* add gettext support
* add UNICODE support
