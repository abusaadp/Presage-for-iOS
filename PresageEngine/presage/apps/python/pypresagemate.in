Pypresagemate is a universal predictive text companion.

Pypresagemate works alongside any AT-SPI aware application. The
Assistive Technology Service Provider Interface (AT-SPI) is a
toolkit-neutral way of providing accessibility facilities in
applications. Pypresagemate works in the background by tracking what
keystrokes are typed and displaying predictions in its window. When a
prediction is selected, text is sent to the active application.
